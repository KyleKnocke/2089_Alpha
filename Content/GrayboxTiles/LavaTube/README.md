# Lava Tube Graybox Tiles

Low-gravity lava-tube segments on the lunar far side. Mix wide caverns with tight choke points and dust fields that obscure sensors.

Priorities:
- Showcase low-g dust dynamics and radio multipath interference.
- Provide cover-and-drift stealth encounters using EM signature management.
- Set up the data-core extraction finale and exfiltration routes.
