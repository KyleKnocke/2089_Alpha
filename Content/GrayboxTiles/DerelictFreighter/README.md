# Derelict Freighter Graybox Tiles

Blockouts for the cislunar cargo hull interior. Use modular kits for cargo bays, maintenance shafts, habitation rings, and decompression chambers.

Focus on:
- EVA hand-rail placement and tether anchor points.
- Power/life-support panel locations for repair beats.
- Occlusion volumes for acoustic stealth gameplay.
