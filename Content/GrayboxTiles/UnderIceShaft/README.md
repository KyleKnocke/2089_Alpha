# Under-Ice Shaft Graybox Tiles

Vertical shaft segments for the Europan ocean setting. Include buoyancy transitions, thermal vents, and narrow chokepoints.

Design goals:
- Demonstrate acoustic thermocline stealth mechanics.
- Provide vertical traversal challenges with low visibility.
- Stage encounters with autonomous probes and tether management puzzles.
